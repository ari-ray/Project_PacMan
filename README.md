# Project_PacMan
A Pacman game built using Python and Pygame
This project focuses in grid-based movement, collision handling and basic ghost behaviour.

## Features
- Move Pacman around a maze using a grid
- Ghosts follow simple decision rules
- Collision handling between Pacman, ghosts and walls
- Restarting the game after losing a life
- A classic Pacman board layout

## Why I Built This
I built this project as a learning exercise to better understand:
- Game loops and state management
- Coordinate systems and grid-based movement
- Collision detection and boundary checks
- Managing multiple game states

This project helped me to get more comfortable working with a larger Python codebase.

## Credits & learning Source
This project was inspired by a Youtube tutorial that explains how to build Pacman using Pygame.

I followed the general structure of the tutorial to understand how the game works, but i made my own changes while building it inclding dimension changes and necessary logic changes that make along with it, changing some basic movement logic, fixing bugs, modifying logic and adapting parts of the code as i learned more about how everything fits together.

The goal of this project was learning and experimentation but not copying.

## How to Run
1. Install Python (3.x)
2. Install Pygame
3. Run the game

## Controls
- Arrow Keys to move Pacman
- Spacebar to restart the game after losing a life or game over

## Project Structure
- main.py for the main game loop, logic and rendering
- Board data is stored in board.py

## Future Improvements
- Additional levels
- Improved ghost behavious
- Better animations
- Adding sound effect
- Code cleanup

## Notes
This project is just a part of my learning journey in Python to get accustomed with pygame and longer Python codebases. It's not meant to be a perfect recreation of the original Pacman but a hands-on way to practice problem solving and debugging.
